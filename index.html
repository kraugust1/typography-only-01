    <h1>Sea Turtles</h1>

    <h3>Small Summery</h3>

    <p>Sea turtles (superfamily Chelonioidea), sometimes called marine turtles, are reptiles of the order Testudines and of the suborder Cryptodira. 
        The seven existing species of sea turtles are the flatback, green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and olive ridley.
        Six of the seven sea turtle species, all but the flatback, are present in U.S. waters, 
        and are listed as endangered and/or threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
        All but the flatback turtle are listed as threatened with extinction globally on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. 
        The flatback turtle is found only in the waters of Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia.</p>
    <h3>stuff stuff</h3>    
        
    <p>For each of the seven species of sea turtles, females and males are the same size. As adults, it is possible to tell male turtles from female turtles by their long tails with a cloacal opening near the tip. 
        Adult female sea turtles have shorter tails, with a cloacal opening near the base. Hatchling and sub-adult turtles do not exhibit sexual dimorphism; 
        it is not possible to determine their sex by looking at them. In general, sea turtles have a more fusiform body plan than their terrestrial or freshwater counterparts. 
        This tapering at both ends reduces volume and means that sea turtles cannot retract their head and limbs into their shells for protection, unlike many other turtles and tortoises. 
        However, the streamlined body plan reduces friction and drag in the water and allows sea turtles to swim more easily and swiftly.
        The leatherback sea turtle is the largest sea turtle, reaching 1.4 to more than 1.8 m (4.6 to 5.9 ft) in length and weighing between 300 and 640 kg (661 to 1,411 lbs).
        Other sea turtle species are smaller, ranging from as little as 60 cm (2 ft) long in the case of the Kemp's ridley, 
        which is the smallest sea turtle species, to 120 cm (3.9 ft) long in the case of the green turtle, the second largest.
        The skulls of sea turtles have cheek regions that are enclosed in bone. Although this condition appears to resemble that found in the earliest known fossil reptiles (anapsids), 
        it is possible it is a more recently evolved trait in sea turtles, placing them outside the anapsids. </p>

    <p>Sea turtles, along with other turtles and tortoises, are part of the order Testudines. All species except the leatherback sea turtle are in the family Cheloniidae. 
        The superfamily name Chelonioidea and family name Cheloniidae are based on the Ancient Greek word for tortoise: χελώνη (khelone). 
        The leatherback sea turtle is the only extant member of the family Dermochelyidae.
        Fossil evidence of marine turtles goes back to the Late Jurassic (150 million years ago) with genera such as Plesiochelys, from Europe. 
        In Africa, the first marine turtle is Angolachelys, from the Turonian of Angola. A lineage of unrelated marine testudines, 
        the pleurodire (side-necked) bothremydids, also survived well into the Cenozoic. Other pleurodires are also thought to have lived at sea, 
        such as Araripemys and extinct pelomedusids. Modern sea turtles are not descended from more than one of the groups of sea-going turtles 
        that have existed in the past; they instead constitute a single radiation that became distinct from all other turtles at least 110 million years ago.
        Their closest extant relatives are in fact the snapping turtles (Chelydridae), musk turtles (Kinosternidae), and hickatee (Dermatemyidae) of the Americas, 
        which alongside the sea turtles constitute the clade Americhelydia. The oldest possible representative of the lineage (Panchelonioidea) leading to 
        modern sea turtles was possibly Desmatochelys padillaifrom the Early Cretaceous. 
        Desmatochelys was a protostegid, a lineage that would later give rise to some very large species but went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous.
        Presently thought to be outside the crown group that contains modern sea turtles (Chelonioidea), 
        the exact relationships of protostegids to modern sea turtles are still debated due to their primitive morphology; 
        they may be the sister group to the Chelonoidea, or an unrelated turtle lineage that convergently evolved similar adaptations.
        The earliest "true" sea turtle that is known from fossils is Nichollsemys from the Early Cretaceous (Albian) of Canada. 
        In 2022, the giant fossil species Leviathanochelys was described from Spain. This species inhabited the oceans covering Europe in the Late Cretaceous 
        and rivaled the concurrent giant protostegids such as Archelon and Protostega as one of the largest turtles to ever exist. Unlike the protostegids, 
        which have an uncertain relationship to modern sea turtles, Leviathanochelys is thought to be a true sea turtle of the superfamily Chelonioidea.
        Sea turtles' limbs and brains have evolved to adapt to their diets. Their limbs originally evolved for locomotion, but more recently evolved to aid them in feeding. 
        They use their limbs to hold, swipe, and forage their food. This helps them eat more efficiently. </p>
