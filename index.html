    <p>Sea turtles (superfamily Chelonioidea), sometimes called marine turtles,[3] are reptiles of the order Testudines and of the suborder Cryptodira. 
        The seven existing species of sea turtles are the flatback, green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and olive ridley.
        [4][5] Six of the seven sea turtle species, all but the flatback, are present in U.S. waters, 
        and are listed as endangered and/or threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
        [6] All but the flatback turtle are listed as threatened with extinction globally on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. 
        The flatback turtle is found only in the waters of Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia.[7][6] </p>
